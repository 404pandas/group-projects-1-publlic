Happy Easter, Group 7!
As you wind down from the day, please look over notes I made while testing your currently's deployed project!
Current error-
api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions:1
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 ()
Resource to assist- https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/401-error/
My theory- Your API key is listed as "var apiKey = "sk-";". Usually API keys are much longer. Fix this, and you might be able to hit that API!
I can see other API calls in the console.log. Good job! Now createElement() and append() to get them on the page!
Navbar not functional
Form not functional
