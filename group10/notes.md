If you find time- try implementing a third API. Your two are created by the same people so the difficulty was quite easy for this project. It could be something as simple as appending a random animal fact from https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/animals-by-api-ninjas/ too the page with a button to loop through them! These are a lot of points you can easily get back with 1-2 hours of coding!
